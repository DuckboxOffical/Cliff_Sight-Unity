# Backstory
This game started off as a competition between @ertbean and I a couple weeks ago, it was a who can make the best full python game and recently we desided to just combind our ideas and make a game together. My original idea was an ascii game with some story I had'nt worked out, @ertbeans's game on the other hand was mostly developed and was in the stage of being coded by him. More recently we met up to see how we were going and decided to combined our efforts and open this GitHub!
